     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <p>Brownie Batter Preparation</p>
     <ol>
        <li><strong>Brown the butter</strong>: Melt butter in a saucepan and cook until it turns golden brown, developing a nutty flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate flavorings</strong>: Stir in espresso powder (and potentially a coffee ice cube to cool it down).</li>
        <li><strong>eggs and sugar</strong>: Beat eggs with sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients</strong>: Sift together flour, cocoa powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet and dry</strong>: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add chocolate</strong>: Fold in melted chocolate (and chocolate chips or chunks, if desired). </li>
     </ol>

     <p>The Long Chill:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Refrigerate for 72 hours:</strong>Pour the batter into a baking pan (lined with parchment for easy removal) and cover it tightly. Refrigerate for 3 days (72 hours). </li>
     </ul>
     <p>Baking and Further Chilling</p>
     <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> the oven to 325°F (163°C). </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the brownies for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. </li>
        <li><strong>Cool and chill:</strong> Let the brownies cool completely in the pan, then cover and refrigerate for another 24 hours. </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> After the final chilling, the brownies can be cut and enjoyed. </li>
